# End-to-End Cricket Data Analytics

This project aims to perform end-to-end data analytics on cricket data, including data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and analysis.

### Data Collection

We use Bright Data for scraping cricket data from ESPN Cricinfo. The data collection is divided into stages:

- Match Results Scraping: Collects match results data.
- Batting Summary Scraping: Gathers batting statistics for players.
- Player Information Scraping: Retrieves player information.

### Data Preprocessing

After collecting the data, we preprocess it using Python scripts:

- Match Results Processing: Processes and stores match results data in CSV format.
- Batting Summary Processing: Processes and stores batting statistics in CSV format.
- Player Information Processing: Processes and stores player information in CSV format.

### Data Visualization and Analysis

We analyze the collected data to gain insights into top performers:

- Top Batsmen Analysis: Visualizes and analyzes top batsmen based on runs scored.
- Top Bowlers Analysis: Visualizes and analyzes top bowlers based on wickets taken.
